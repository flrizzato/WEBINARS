[Server.Authorization]
;# This section is for setting authorization requirements for resources and endpoints.
;# Authorization can be set on built-in resource (e.g.; Users) and on custom resources.
;# Note that when MasterSecret authentication is used, these requirements are ignored.
;# Resource settings apply to all endpoints in the resource.
;# Endpoint settings override the settings for the resource.
;# By default, all resource are public.
;# Settings are specified in JSON.
;# JSON attributes
;#  {"public": true} - any client is authorized
;#  {"public": false} - a client may be authorized depending on user or group.  user credentials (sessionid) must passed in the request
;#  {"users": ["username1", "username2"]} - authorize a user by username.
;#  {"users": ["userid1", "userid2"]} - authorize a user by userid.
;#  {"users": ["*"]} - authorize any user.
;#  {"groups": ["groupname1", "groupname2"]} - authorize a user in a user group.
;#  {"groups": ["*"]} - authorize a user in any user group
;#
;# Examples
;#
;# Make all methods in the resource "Users" private except for LoginUser and SignupUser endpoints
;Users={"public": false}
;Users.LoginUser={"public": true}
;Users.SignupUser={"public": true}
;#
;# Make all methods in the custom resource "Resource1" available to users in group1
;Resource1={"groups": ["group1"]}
;#
;# Make all methods in the custom resource "Resource2" available only with MasterSecret authentication
;Resource2={"public": false}
;#
;# Special rules for user and group creators.
;# The creator of user is automatically authorized for the following endpoints:
;#   Users.GetUser, Users.UpdateUser, Users.DeleteUser
;# The creator of a group is automatically authorized for the following endpoints:
;#   Groups.GetGroup, Groups.UpdateGroup, Groups.DeleteGroup

[Server.Redirect]
;# This section is for setting resource redirects.
;# Redirects cause custom resources to handle a client request, rather than the
;# resource identified in the request URL.
;# A redirect may apply to all endpoints in a resource, or to a particular endpoint.
;# The destination resource must have an endpoint that handles the HTTP method (e.g.; GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URL segments of the
;# client request.  Endpoint names are not used to resolve the destination endpoint.
;# Examples:
;#
;# Redirect all endpoints of the built-in resource "Users" to the custom resource "MyUsers"
;Users={"destination":"MyUsers"}
;#
;# Redirect specific endpoints to the custom resource "MyUsers"
;Users.LoginUser={"destination":"MyUsers"}
;Users.SignupUser={"destination":"MyUsers"}

;# value is an array of file extensions. Only these files will be accessible from this directory.
;# The optional "charset" value specifies default charset for the files in the directory.
